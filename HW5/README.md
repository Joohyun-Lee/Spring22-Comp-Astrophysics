I am planning to present a paper from Cosmic-Dawn (CoDa) collaboration, which Paul, Taha, and I are part of.
Recently, the collaboration posted a paper on arXiv (2202.05869) that descirbes result and method of CoDa-III simulation.
The series of CoDa simulation employs an N-body GPU-CPU unigrid RHD code, RAMSES-CUDATON, which is an integration of RAMSES hydrodynamics code and ATON RT code.
Because I haven't been an expert of our CoDa simulations, I am thinking about digging into the previos CoDa simulation papers and RAMSES, ATON, RAMSES-CUDATON method papers to understand the method and present the method and the computational approach.
